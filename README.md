The Save Terrain plugin button allows you to save your terrain into a script. The script is just used to hold the text. Running the script will not do anything but shout errors. Select the script with the terrain data and press the Load Terrain plugin button to load terrain into the current map.

**NOTE**: When saving terrain, the game will become very laggy. Just sit still, don't try to move the camera around, and wait patiently for the plugin to collect all the data.

Installation
------------

 1. Open up ROBLOX Studio
 2. On top toolbar, go to Tools > Open Plugins Folder
 3. Extract this zipped folder to the plugins folder
 4. Restart ROBLOX Studio (Close and reopen it)

Step 4 is a precaution step. It may not be needed but in some cases will be needed. Follow it just for precaution. You are seriously lazy if you can't close and reopen it!

NOTE: Plugins will only appear when you are in Edit or Solo mode on your game.
