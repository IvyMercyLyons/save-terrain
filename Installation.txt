Installation:

1) Open up ROBLOX Studio
2) On top toolbar, go to Tools > Open Plugins Folder
3) Extract this zipped folder to the plugins folder
4) Restart ROBLOX Studio (Close and reopen it)

Step 4 is a precaution step. It may not be needed but in some cases
will be needed. Follow it just for precaution. You are seriously
lazy if you can't close and reopen it!

NOTE: Plugins will only appear when you are in Edit or Solo mode on your game.
